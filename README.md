# motorsport-wordpress
<h1>So, to run this you'll need to keep a few things in mind:
<h3>1. insatallation:
You'll need:
  - Wordpress (of course you will)
  - Some form of server and database (I assume xampp for this)  
  - Recommend this guide:
  https://elementor.com/academy/install-wordpress-xampp/
  (if you're a retard like me and forgot your password, just run mysqld --skip-grant-tables to run in safe mode, then reset credentials)
  - Put the motorsport folder in htdocs
  - Enter Localhost to access Wordpress
<h3>2. Add-ons:
There're a few add-ons that I used in this site. Make sure that they're activated if you want this run normally:
 - Ajax Load More: To handle the load more blog posts
 - Gutena Forms: for email handlings
 - WP forms/WP mail: for the forms themselves
 - cars-post-type: This is to handle cars as a seperate POST type. 
<h2> DO NOT. I REPEAT. DO NOT DEACTIVATE THIS IF YOU WANT THIS TO RUN
<h3>3. Themes:
 - The one you're looking to activate is called Astra child. 
But don't touch anything about Astra itself, or the 2025 theme. There are a few things I imported over
