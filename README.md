# motorsport-wordpress
<h1>So, to run this you'll need to keep a few things in mind:</h1>
<h3>1. insatallation:</h3>
<p>You'll need:</p>
<p> - Wordpress (of course you will)</p>
<p> - Some form of server and database (I assume xampp for this)</p>
<p> - Recommend this guide: https://elementor.com/academy/install-wordpress-xampp/</p>
<p>(if you're a retard like me and forgot your password, just run mysqld --skip-grant-tables to run in safe mode, then reset credentials)</p>
<p> - Put the motorsport folder in htdocs</p>
<p> - Enter Localhost to access Wordpress</p>
<h3>2. Add-ons:</h3>
<p>There're a few add-ons that I used in this site. Make sure that they're activated if you want this run normally:</p>
<p> - Ajax Load More: To handle the load more blog posts</p>
<p> - Gutena Forms: for email handlings</p>
<p> - WP forms/WP mail: for the forms themselves</p>
<p> - cars-post-type.php: This is to handle cars as a seperate POST type.</p> 
<h2> DO NOT. I REPEAT. DO NOT DEACTIVATE THIS IF YOU WANT TO RUN</h2>
<h3>3. Themes:</h3>
<p> - The one you're looking to activate is called Astra child.</p>
<p>But don't touch anything about Astra itself, or the 2025 theme. There are a few things I imported over</p>
